After the analysis, I concluded that the length of stay indeed does impact the average mental health scores of the international students due to the trend of the scores increasing as time went on.<img width="945" height="522" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13f49039-8d49-4c68-8b6e-8c7a99c41b57" />
